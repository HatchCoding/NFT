                <h2>What makes an NFT successful?</h2>
                <p> There are a few things that you can do to ensure that your NFTs are a success on the market. Just like any other market, there is a lot of competition. Ensuring that your work is special is important. </p> 
                <h3>Befor You Buy and Sell</h3> 
                <p>Remember, posting and selling NFTs cost REAL money. You will need to speak with your parents about this and let them know about the minting and gas fees. You are not guarenteed to sell your NFTs as well so you could lose the money that you invested. There is a video at the bottom of this lesson that explains some of the risks involved with NFTs and how to make a better product. </p> 
                <h2>Checklist for Success</h2>
                <p> Go through the following checklist to see if your NFT is ready to post and if you have a robust backstory to help you sell your NFT. There is more to think about than just creating a base image. Think about why someone would want to buy your image. </p> 
                <div>Visual Impact</div>
<ul >
<li>Is it eye-catching?</li>
<li>Does it look professional or interesting?</li><li>Does it have good Composition / Design?</li>
</ul>
<div>Creativity</div>
<ul><li>Is it a completely unique design?</li><li>How is it different than other art?</li><li>Why would someone want to buy it?</li><li>How is it relevant to today?</li><li>Is this directed at a specific market, would I be able to see who should buy this?</li>
</ul>
<div>Variation Options</div>
<ul><li>How many possible variations are there?</li><li>Are there some variations that are randomly generated rarer than others? If so why?</li><li>How large is your selected collection of files?</li><li>What makes each variation special?</li><li>How will you create scarcity with your collection?</li>
</ul>
<div>Storyline</div>
<ul>
<li>What is the story behind your art?</li><li>What does it mean and why is it important?</li><li>How do the various images connect?</li><li>Does own more than one image have any importance?</li><li>What makes your collection special?</li>
</ul>
<div>Background on Creation</div>
<ul><li>Where is your other art or work shown?</li><li>Do you have a website or a page where buyers can explore your backstory?</li><li>What makes you and your art more special than the average NFT poster?</li><li>Is this tied to your background in some way? How could someone connect to your story better? Age, cultural background, home country, etc.</li>
</ul>

                <h2> Concerns with Art and NFTs </h2>
                <p> As awesome as this all sounds, there are still some things to be aware of in terms of NFTs. Not all NFTs are bought and not everyone becomes a millionaire. You need to make sure you have thought about some of the reasons why NFT artists are unsuccessful as well. Watch the following video to learn more about this concept and how to make your art more likely to sell. </p>
